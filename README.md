The dataset analyzed however might have some limitations that hinders the accuracy of the analysis regarding other factors that might affect the outcomes of a fundraising campaign such as backer's demographics (age, gender, race...), or any marketing expense involved.
A further study on the percentage funded of the campaigns in the dataset should be helpful for Louise in her decision making process. As it gives a more detailed analysis on the profitability of these campaigns.
